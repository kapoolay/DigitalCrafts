# skware-cash

Welcome! Skware Cash is a simple clone of Square Cash designed to be a playground for Chrome DevTools. Please note that this isn't a complete clone - only the transactions list has been rebuilt.

You will find 8 folders named "bug". Each of them contain nearly identical copies of these 5 files:

- bug-report.txt
- index.html
- index.css
- index.js
- data.js

Your task is to discover and patch the bugs in each of the bug folders! Begin by reading the bug-report.txt and then using Chrome's DevTools to uncover the bug's underlying issue. 

The last two bugs are a bit tough! Remember, Google is your friend - don't be afraid to search the web for possible solutions.
