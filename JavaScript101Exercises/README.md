JavaScript Exercises

You will be rewriting in JavaScript a series of exercises you've written in Python. There will also be a few new challenges. Because JavaScript's pop-up prompt is annoying and doesn't work in Node, we won't take in any user input. Instead, you will write each exercise as a function, and any required input will be supplied to the function as arguments.
