# Color Palette Generator

Your task is to implement a React color palette generator similar to the one at https://coolors.co

Your app should:
1) Have a "Randomize Colors" button
2) Show 5 colors on the screen
3) Each color should have a hex code and a "LOCK/UNLOCK" button
4) Clicking the "Randomize Colors" buton should only randomize the colors of the unlocked sections

index.html includes Bootstrap v4 for your convenience. If you want an example of how to design your HTML, check out https://codepen.io/anon/pen/LqXPbB?editors=1000
