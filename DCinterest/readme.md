# DCinterest

Your task is to recreate the design for DCinterest (see design.jpeg) which is inspired by Pinterest. The design is pretty simple - it includes a navbar at the top, and a collection of "cards" displayed below it. To achieve this layout, you will use both Bootstrap and flex styling

## What will I use Bootstrap for?

The top navbar is a Bootstrap Navbar. For detailed instructions on how to implement it, watch this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0uNai3XyKQ

The cards themselves are also from Bootstrap. Specifically, look at the bootstrap documentation for "card image overlays": https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/card/#image-overlays

Make sure that the cards are no wider than 200px.

## What will I use flex styling for?

The cards on the page should be contained in a div with the class name "card-container". Use flex styling on this div to achieve the desired arrangement of cards.
