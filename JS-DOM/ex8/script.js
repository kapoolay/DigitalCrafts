    Make a Todo List
    0) Make it so that after entering the task and clicking the "Add Task" button, that new task appears inside the todo-list.
    1) Add the ability to check off tasks by clicking on them - (text-decoration:strikethrough is a nice way to)
    BONUS) Add a functioning "delete" button to each task (HINT: use the keyword "this" in your delete button's click listener! Console log "this" to see what value it holds)
    SUPER BONUS) Make each task editable
